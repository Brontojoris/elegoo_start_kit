# ESP-WROOM-32S ESP32 Module

## Introduction

The ESP-WROOM-32S development board integrates a variety of peripherals, including capacitive touch sensors, Hall sensors, low noise amplifiers, SD card interface, Ethernet interface, and high-speed SDIO/SPI, UART, I2S, I2C, etc.

This board was purchased from Amazon and branded as ESP-WROOM-32S ESP Board. The ultimate manufacturer is [DOIT](https://www.doit.am/).

Schematics and a bulletin board is available at: [DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1](http://bbs.doit.am/forum.php).

## Getting it working

### Arduino IDE

1. Connect Arduino to PC/Mac via USB-C cable.
2. Launch Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Blink sketch from main menu bar > File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink.
4. From the main menu bar, open Tools > Board > Boards Manager.
5. Search for "esp32".
6. Install the version by Espressif Systems.
7. From the main menu bar, open Tools > Boards > esp32 > DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1. **NOTE**: *The list is long and not in any kind of order so it can be tricky to find DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1.*
8. From the main menu bar, click Sketch > Upload.
9. The code should compile and upload and run on the ESP32.

### ESP32 over Wi-Fi

[Notes for using ESP-WROOM-32S ESP32 Module to local Wi-Fi](wifi.md)

### Arduino Cloud

### CLion + Platform.io

[Platform.io listing](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/esp32doit-devkit-v1.html)

#### Platform.io configuration

Please use** `esp32doit-devkit-v1` ID for board option in platformio.ini

```
[env:esp32doit-devkit-v1]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32doit-devkit-v1
```

You can override default DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 settings per build environment using `board_***` option, where `***` is a JSON object path from board manifest esp32doit-devkit-v1.json. For example, board_build.mcu, board_build.f_cpu, etc.

```
[env:esp32doit-devkit-v1]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32doit-devkit-v1

; change microcontroller
board_build.mcu = esp32

; change MCU frequency
board_build.f_cpu = 240000000L
```
